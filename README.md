# react-native
react-native is a repo i created to keep track of all the mini-projects i make while studying react-native and android app development
The process of react-native installation is no way as easy as react.js setup...OMG
I used https://www.techomoro.com/how-to-install-and-setup-react-native-on-ubuntu-18-04-1-lts-bionic-beaver/ as my instruction guide. This link is for linux os but there's also that for windows
Ok, in the installation of react-native these are some points to remember that MUST be done:
    -make sure the necessary requirements at Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) are checked
    -make sure to CONFIGURE ANDROID_HOME ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
During the installation process make sure to have a steady,reliable and fast(as fast as possible) internet supply. A slow network may trigger errors...or fustrate you
